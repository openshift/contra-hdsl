<h1>withHdslPod</h1>
<p>
  This Jenkinsfile step creates a podTemplate, populated with the necessary
  containers required to utilize the Contra-HDSL Library.
</p>
<p>
  This step writes an environmental variable <code>hdslPodName</code> which refers
  to the name of the created pod. This can be used in a <code>node()</code> call
  as seen in the Usage Examples section.
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  This step assumes that the Jenkins instance is running on OpenShift
</p>
<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
<h3>Default Usage</h3>
<p>
  The default usage creates the pod and populates it with images pulled from the
  default HDSL image source. Currently this is OpenShift.
</p>
<strong>Note:</strong> There is a plan to transition to pulling the images directly from Docker Hub soon.
